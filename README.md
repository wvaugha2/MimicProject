# MimicProject: Mimic Dataset Generation Library

## About
This repository is for developing the Mimic Dataset Generation Library (MDGL), which is a python tool for the MIMIC-III database that will easily obtain patient information, performing data cleansing and formatting as specified by the user.  The different aspects of the MDGL are well-separated to allow for easily updating how data is processed.  The documentation for the MDGL can be found in the document MDGLDocumentation (both a word document and pdf are included in the repository).
